# Inside the mind of a master procrastinator [TED视频链接](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator)

> #### Aout The Talk
Tim Urban, the speaker, knows that procrastination doesn't make sense, but he's never been able to shake his habit of waiting until the last minute to get things done. In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.

***
 There are exits **Rational Decision-Maker**, **Instant Gratification Monkey** in our brain. The *Monkey* ask *Decision-Maker* to do tings easy and fun rather than what should be done at right time. So, it will cause procrastination.

 
 Fortunately, the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in procrastination moments -- someone called the **Panic Monster**. The *Panic Monstaer* suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too closer or there is danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. The *Panic Monster* kick out *Monky*, and let *Decison-Maker* control procrastinator's brain again.

 Until here, the speaker has already introduced the whole process of procrastination from start to end. Howerver, the most impressed content I influenced was the final satge of the speech. 

>There's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline.

>In this situation, the *Panic Monster* doesn't show up. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. 


So, we need to stay aware of the *Instant Gratification Monkey*. Do it now.
